# Deepfake Hindi Audio Detection and Authentication
## Overview
The Deepfake Hindi Audio Detection and Authentication project is a machine learning-based system designed to detect and authenticate deepfake audio clips in Hindi. The system utilizes advanced neural network architectures to analyze audio signals and identify manipulated content, helping to combat misinformation and protect audio integrity.

## Features
- Preprocessing of audio files
- Training and validation of deep learning models
- Detection of deepfake audio clips
- Authentication of genuine audio clips
- Visualization of detection results
## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Librosa
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
## Dataset
The dataset for this project includes real and deepfake Hindi audio clips. The dataset can be obtained from Deepfake Audio Dataset or any other relevant source.
